Download the 7z archive and extract to view the html and css for my website. The website is a work in progress for another class, basically a prototype for the website my team needs to do in Team Projects 1. Currently it just has a link to display some test images and download the test images.

**NOTE TO SELF**
After extracting, you may need to rename some directories.
