# Part 1: Dockerize it

## Part 1: Overview

For part 1 of this project, the goals are to...
1. Create the new repository for projects 4 and 5 (which this file is currently in).
2. Create a folder within the new repo called website which will house your website content (html, css, and script files).
3. Install Docker, which is software used for creating and running container applications. Per the Docker site https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/ a container is "A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings."
4. Using Docker, create a container image that will run a webserver (nginx) that will be serving up your website. I assume this means creating a container that has all the files needed to run nginx and have nginx work enough to serve the website content.
5. Create a Dockerfile and use it. Per the Docker site https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/ a Dockerfile is "Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. This page describes the commands you can use in a Dockerfile."
6. Ensure the website content and Dockerfile are all in this repo.

## Part 1: Process documentation

- Added directory to Project4 directory called website, and included my 7z archive which contains the files for my prototype website for Team Projects 1. The site is not complete, but it is complete enough to work/look fine.
- Installed Docker in my WSL Ubuntu system. Used this site: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
- The above website walks you through the commands needed to install and confirm installation of Docker.
- See screenshots...

## Part 1: Creating a container image and dockerfile

- Found https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/deploy-a-custom-nginx-docker-image-and-push-it-to-docker-hub-118f1ab2186b. Seems like a good initial test.
- Started local ubuntu machine. Made a directory called proj4test to carry out this test.
- Put the 7z archive with my site files in proj4test.
- Made new directory /proj4test/containering and ran "sudo docker pull nginx:latest"

Output
```text
jacob@lappy:~/proj4test/containering$ sudo docker pull nginx:latest
[sudo] password for jacob:

```

Verfied it worked
```text
jacob@lappy:~/proj4test/containering$ sudo docker images
REPOSITORY    TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
nginx         latest    92b11f67642b   4 weeks ago     187MB
hello-world   latest    d2c94e258dcb   10 months ago   13.3kB
```

- Unzipped site files using "7z x 4980_testsite.7z"
- Created testfile which is my dockerfile based on the article.

```text
jacob@lappy:~/proj4test/containering$ cat testfile
FROM nginx:1.10.1-alpine
COPY /home/jacob/proj4test/4980_testsite/ /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

- Ran "sudo docker build -t testing ."
- Error, assuming because the file is named testfile not dockerfile, renamed and reran.
- Another error, more verbose, see below...

```

- Permissions issue? Path issue?
- Made some changes. Now I have a directory /home/jacob/proj4test. In that is a dockerfile and the 4980testsite directory that contains all site related files. See below for dockerfile...

```text
FROM nginx:1.10.1-alpine
COPY 4980_testsite /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

- Ran "sudo docker build -t testing ." FROM the /home/jacob/proj4test directory.
- No errors apparently.
- Confirmed "testing" existed using "docker images" command.

```text
jacob@lappy:~/proj4test$ sudo docker images

```

- Now attempting to build and deploy container using "docker run -d --name <name-container> -p 8080:80 <new_image_name>"
- So my command should be "sudo docker run -d --name testaroo -p 8080:80 testing" see below...

    </div>
</body>
</html>jacob@lappy:~/proj4test$

```

- So it is working sort of, I can curl localhost:8080 and get the HTML, when I go their using a web browser though it only half works, the CSS and other pages are busted see below...

- I also checked using "sudo docker ps" to see it running.
- Stopped the container using "sudo docker stop testaroo"
