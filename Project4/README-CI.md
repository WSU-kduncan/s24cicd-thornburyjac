# Part 1: Dockerize it

## Part 1: Overview

For part 1 of this project, the goals are to...
1. Create the new repository for projects 4 and 5 (which this file is currently in).
2. Create a folder within the new repo called website which will house your website content (html, css, and script files).
3. Install Docker, which is software used for creating and running container applications. Per the Docker site https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/ a container is "A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings."
4. Using Docker, create a container image that will run a webserver (nginx) that will be serving up your website. I assume this means creating a container that has all the files needed to run nginx and have nginx work enough to serve the website content.
5. Create a Dockerfile and use it. Per the Docker site https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/ a Dockerfile is "Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. This page describes the commands you can use in a Dockerfile."
6. Ensure the website content and Dockerfile are all in this repo.

## Part 1: Process documentation

- Added directory to Project4 directory called website, and included my 7z archive which contains the files for my prototype website for Team Projects 1. The site is not complete, but it is complete enough to work/look fine.
- Installed Docker in my WSL Ubuntu system. Used this site: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
- The above website walks you through the commands needed to install and confirm installation of Docker.
- See screenshots...

## Part 1: Creating a container image and dockerfile

- Found https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/deploy-a-custom-nginx-docker-image-and-push-it-to-docker-hub-118f1ab2186b. Seems like a good initial test.
- Started local ubuntu machine. Made a directory called proj4test to carry out this test.
- Put the 7z archive with my site files in proj4test.
- Made new directory /proj4test/containering and ran "sudo docker pull nginx:latest"

Output
```text
jacob@lappy:~/proj4test/containering$ sudo docker pull nginx:latest
[sudo] password for jacob:

```

Verfied it worked
```text
jacob@lappy:~/proj4test/containering$ sudo docker images
REPOSITORY    TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE

hello-world   latest    d2c94e258dcb   10 months ago   13.3kB
```

- Unzipped site files using "7z x 4980_testsite.7z"
- Created testfile which is my dockerfile based on the article.

```text
jacob@lappy:~/proj4test/containering$ cat testfile
FROM nginx:1.10.1-alpine
COPY /home/jacob/proj4test/4980_testsite/ /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

- Ran "sudo docker build -t testing ."
- Error, assuming because the file is named testfile not dockerfile, renamed and reran.
- Another error, more verbose, see below...

```

- Permissions issue? Path issue?
- Made some changes. Now I have a directory /home/jacob/proj4test. In that is a dockerfile and the 4980testsite directory that contains all site related files. See below for dockerfile...

```text
FROM nginx:1.10.1-alpine
COPY 4980_testsite /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

- Ran "sudo docker build -t testing ." FROM the /home/jacob/proj4test directory.
- No errors apparently.
- Confirmed "testing" existed using "docker images" command.

```text
jacob@lappy:~/proj4test$ sudo docker images

```

- Now attempting to build and deploy container using "docker run -d --name <name-container> -p 8080:80 <new_image_name>"
- So my command should be "sudo docker run -d --name testaroo -p 8080:80 testing" see below...

```

- So it is working sort of, I can curl localhost:8080 and get the HTML, when I go their using a web browser though it only half works, the CSS and other pages are busted see below...

- I also checked using "sudo docker ps" to see it running.
- Stopped the container using "sudo docker stop testaroo"

- Permissions issue causing the broken site? Tried again but changed dockerfile to...

```text
FROM nginx:1.10.1-alpine
COPY 4980_testsite /usr/share/nginx/html
RUN chown -R www-data:www-data /usr/share/nginx/html/4980_testsite \
    && chmod -R 750 /usr/share/nginx/html/4980_testsite
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

```

- Issue persists after building and testing with that new dockerfile.
- Testing with this dockerfile

```text
FROM nginx:1.10.1-alpine
COPY 4980_testsite /usr/share/nginx/html
RUN chown -R www-data:www-data /usr/share/nginx/html/4980_testsite \
    && chmod -R 750 /usr/share/nginx/html/4980_testsite
RUN rm /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
RUN echo "server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;

        root /var/www/html/4980_testsite;

        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name _;

        location / {
                # First attempt to serve request as file, then
                # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
}
" > /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

- Issue persists, links and css still broken. It does still work sorta, as in I can navigate to localhost:8080 and get some html, and the links still go the the files they are just broken.
- Changed the dockerfile to instead make root the owner of the site files instead of www-data.
- Issue persists.
- Changed permission to be 755 instead of 750 for www-data. This is based on the output of the "sudo docker logs testaroo4" command which shows permission denied messages.
- During troubleshooting it seems that the directory copy was not working as expected, see commands and output...

```

- Issue persists.
- **ORDER OF OPERATIONS MATTER**, may be causing these issues due to completely muddling up the order multiple times. Setup the dockerfile, build the image, run the container, test. If issues are happening you need to start FROM THE BEGINNING.

## Part 1: Frequent commands
Run this command in the directory with your dockerfile to create your image using the dockerfile: `sudo docker build -t <IMAGE_NAME> .`
Run this command to build/deploy container: `docker run -d --name <CONTAINER_NAME> -p 8080:80 <IMAGE_NAME>`
Run this command to view running containers: `sudo docker ps`
Run this command to view ALL containers running and stopped: `sudo docker ps -a`
Run this command to stop container that was deployed: `sudo docker stop <CONTAINER_NAME>`
Run this command to view files in image: `sudo docker run --rm <IMAGE_NAME> ls -l /file/path`
Run this command to view container logs: `sudo docker logs <CONTAINER_NAME>`
Run this command to view images: `sudo docker images`
Run this command to remove images (-f to force): `sudo docker rmi <CONTAINER_NAME>`

## Part 1: Resources used

https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/ Site used to define what a container is

https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/ Site used to define what a Dockerfile is
