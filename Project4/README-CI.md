# Part 1: Dockerize it

## Part 1: Process documentation

- Added directory to Project4 directory called website, and included my 7z archive which contains the files for my prototype website for Team Projects 1. The site is not complete, but it is complete enough to work/look fine.
- Installed Docker in my WSL Ubuntu system. Used this site: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
- The above website walks you through the commands needed to install and confirm installation of Docker.
- See screenshots...
